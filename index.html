      <td>Responses to children missing and at risk of child sexual exploitation While there is considerable evidence of effective joint work with individual young people subject to sexual exploitation, broader operational activity to robustly and persistently deter, target and pursue perpetrators requires strengthening. Plans to improve prevention of exploitation through targeting places where abuse might occur (such as hotels and licensed premises) are yet to be consistently developed and delivered. In one case, this led to a young person being appropriately placed in secure accommodation for their own protection, but not enough action was taken to deter those who posed a risk to the young person.</td>
      <td>Current arrangements within the single access referral hub are strong. Thresholds for intervention are generally understood and applied well by almost all agencies.

A recent initiative by police and health partners has sought to raise awareness in the community about signs and indicators of exploitation.</td>
      <td>Until this inspection, strategic multi-agency partners did not understand the extent and impact of the failure to protect children and drive forward plans for those who are at risk of, or are victims of, criminal and sexual exploitation. Notwithstanding the tangible commitment and ambition of all partners to improving services, there is insufficient senior leadership analysis of the underlying complexities or understanding of the day-to-day experiences of these vulnerable children. These are serious and fundamental weaknesses, leaving some children in situations of unassessed risk and harm.</td>

      <td>Not found or not applicable.</td>
      <td>Identifying and managing risk of harm at the front door There are a number of ways in which responses to children experiencing neglect can be further developed and improved to ensure a consistently timely and appropriate response from all professionals in CWAC. For example, in a small number of cases where there were concerns about neglect, frontline police officers did not complete vulnerable persons assessments (VPAs) so that information was not then passed to childrens social care. In these cases, increasing incidents of concern eventually resulted in a referral by the police to childrens social care, but the opportunity for a timely referral and earlier intervention had been lost.</td>
      <td>There is clear drive at a strategic level in Cheshire West and Chester to embed a shared approach across partners to tackle neglect. This is resulting in effective practice at the frontline of many services to identify and support children suffering neglect. Strong partnership working and mature relationships, where there is challenge between agencies and from the LSCB chair, are driving improvement and leading to effective multi-agency working in many cases seen during this inspection.</td>

      <td>Identifying and managing risk of harm at the front door There has been no dedicated health professional in the MASH for the past 12 months. While arrangements to access information from health visitors, school nurses and the emergency departments at Airedale General Hospital and Bradford Royal Infirmary work well, information gathering from adult mental health, CAMHS and adult substance misuse is less well secured. Health participation in strategy discussions is inconsistent and may not always ensure that relevant information is shared and used to identify needs and analyse risk or assure compliance with Working Together 2015.</td>

Examples include the local domestic abuse partnership inspector hosting a meeting in January with dedicated LGBT support workers from Bradford Womens Aid and Staying Put, as well as a transgender support service in Bradford, discussing ways to improve the support services for LGBT victims, and raising awareness amongst frontline workers who deal with abuse in LGBT households.</td>

During this inspection, inspectors did not find any child at immediate risk of significant harm where this has not been recognised and appropriate action taken. However, services at this early point of involvement with children are not well joined up and any action taken can be sequential, causing cumulative delay in response.</td>
      <td>A strong, shared commitment to working in a child-focused way and listening to the voices of children and young people characterises the work of agencies in York.

For example, in a recent child sexual abuse investigation involving a number of children, the police showed a child-centred and nuanced approach.</td>

Mature partnership arrangements are in place. Since 2019, partners in Coventry have continued to focus on serious youth violence and exploitation.</td>
      <td>The emergency duty team provides a minimal safeguarding response to incidents of serious youth violence, meaning that strategy meetings are not held at the earliest opportunity and plans are made to provide immediate protection for younger children in the family without a social worker seeing the child or family to assess. Children wait too long to receive mental health assessments from the child and adolescent mental health services crisis teams, and children who become looked after wait too long for their initial health assessment. Some professionals are not sufficiently curious and accept childrens explanations at face value, which results in risks to children and young people not being wholly understood.</td>

      <td>Senior leaders in partner agencies have a shared and well-developed vision for early help in the Wirral. Staff across statutory and voluntary agencies have understood and engaged with this. There is a broad range of locality-based early help and family support services available to children and their families that are making a positive difference.</td>
      <td>Children and families in the Wirral are benefiting from a broad and generally well- coordinated range of family support and early help services that make a positive difference to their lives. Strategic leaders from the police, health agencies and the local authority have a clear understanding of practice across the partnership and know themselves well, actively inviting internal and external challenge. Cohesive leadership and healthy challenge have enabled the partnership to develop a strong and effective early help offer to children and their families.</td>
      <td>How effectively the early help offer is further developed to ensure greater consistency of access for children across the local authority area. The proportion of children receiving early help who benefit from a coordinated multi-agency plan to coordinate that support and to help ensure that it is as effective as possible. How well the early help needs of children with special educational needs and/or disabilities are met.</td>

      <td>Identifying and managing risk of harm at the front door There are a number of areas of practice at the front door of services, in particular in the MASH, where further work is needed to ensure a consistent, and considered multi-agency approach to joint risk-assessment and decision- making in cases of neglect. Most significantly, more joint work is required at the early stages of assessment, when agencies are first made aware of children at risk of neglect. There were examples in a small number of cases where police officers had failed to effectively investigate concerns about adults who were linked to children who are experiencing neglect.</td>
      <td>Strong and visible leadership by the Wokingham director of childrens services is evident in promoting a clear and shared direction with partner agencies in safeguarding children and young people at risk of neglect. The work undertaken alongside senior leaders in partner agencies whose responsibilities span a number of other local authority areas has helped to ensure that the specific needs of Wokinghams population are recognised. The development of the local MASH in 2016 is a strong example of ensuring that the needs of Wokinghams children are prioritised and responded to.</td>

      <td>The GP role in the recognition of neglect The role of GPs in recognising and taking steps to reduce and help address harm to children and young people at risk of neglect was strong in two GP practices that were visited. The issues that GPs are helping young people and their families to deal with are hidden or difficult to detect in an area of relative affluence such as Wokingham. These include the impact on childrens emotional and mental well-being where parents exert undue pressure and have idealised expectations that their children will achieve highly in all aspects of their lives.</td>
