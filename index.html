An effective and equitable offer to homeless children is leading to positive outcomes for these vulnerable children.</td>
      <td>A strong, caring leadership ethos, based on doing what is right for children in Blackpool, means that a large majority of children get the right help when they need it. The high quality of both strategic and operational partnership in Blackpool ensures that there is an effective identification and response to childrens needs and risks. Over the last year, the area has moved from joint Multi-Agency Safeguarding Arrangements (MASA) with other neighbouring areas to a specifically place-based MASA with a single focus on children in Blackpool.</td>
      <td>How well partnership performance information and quality assurance are used to support effective multi-agency working. The effectiveness with which the partnership engages with schools to reduce the very high rate of permanent exclusions that is currently exacerbating the vulnerability of children.

      <td>Responses to children missing and at risk of child sexual exploitation While there is considerable evidence of effective joint work with individual young people subject to sexual exploitation, broader operational activity to robustly and persistently deter, target and pursue perpetrators requires strengthening. Plans to improve prevention of exploitation through targeting places where abuse might occur (such as hotels and licensed premises) are yet to be consistently developed and delivered. In one case, this led to a young person being appropriately placed in secure accommodation for their own protection, but not enough action was taken to deter those who posed a risk to the young person.</td>
      <td>Current arrangements within the single access referral hub are strong. Thresholds for intervention are generally understood and applied well by almost all agencies.

Emerging evidence of targeted disruption work in the community by youth justice staff, youth workers and police officers. A recent initiative by police and health partners has sought to raise awareness in the community about signs and indicators of exploitation.</td>
      <td>Until this inspection, strategic multi-agency partners did not understand the extent and impact of the failure to protect children and drive forward plans for those who are at risk of, or are victims of, criminal and sexual exploitation. Notwithstanding the tangible commitment and ambition of all partners to improving services, there is insufficient senior leadership analysis of the underlying complexities or understanding of the day-to-day experiences of these vulnerable children. These are serious and fundamental weaknesses, leaving some children in situations of unassessed risk and harm.</td>
      <td>The consistent recording and analysis of childrens voices across all agencies records.

      <td>Not found or not applicable.</td>
      <td>Identifying and managing risk of harm at the front door There are a number of ways in which responses to children experiencing neglect can be further developed and improved to ensure a consistently timely and appropriate response from all professionals in CWAC. For example, in a small number of cases where there were concerns about neglect, frontline police officers did not complete vulnerable persons assessments (VPAs) so that information was not then passed to childrens social care. In these cases, increasing incidents of concern eventually resulted in a referral by the police to childrens social care, but the opportunity for a timely referral and earlier intervention had been lost.</td>
      <td>There is clear drive at a strategic level in Cheshire West and Chester to embed a shared approach across partners to tackle neglect. This is resulting in effective practice at the frontline of many services to identify and support children suffering neglect. Strong partnership working and mature relationships, where there is challenge between agencies and from the LSCB chair, are driving improvement and leading to effective multi-agency working in many cases seen during this inspection.</td>

While arrangements to access information from health visitors, school nurses and the emergency departments at Airedale General Hospital and Bradford Royal Infirmary work well, information gathering from adult mental health, CAMHS and adult substance misuse is less well secured.

Examples include the local domestic abuse partnership inspector hosting a meeting in January with dedicated LGBT support workers from Bradford Womens Aid and Staying Put, as well as a transgender support service in Bradford, discussing ways to improve the support services for LGBT victims, and raising awareness amongst frontline workers who deal with abuse in LGBT households.</td>

During this inspection, inspectors did not find any child at immediate risk of significant harm where this has not been recognised and appropriate action taken. However, services at this early point of involvement with children are not well joined up and any action taken can be sequential, causing cumulative delay in response.</td>

For example, in a recent child sexual abuse investigation involving a number of children, the police showed a child-centred and nuanced approach.</td>

The quality of direct work with children to help them understand what is happening to them and their family.</td>
      <td>Unborn children, and those aged 0 to 7 who are victims of domestic abuse in North Yorkshire, are seen, understood and safeguarded by professionals and key people in their own communities. North Yorkshire is a large and complex county where children live in coastal, holiday towns with seasonal poverty, on the outskirts of neighbouring cities, in small towns (including an army garrison the size of a small town) and many attend small rural schools. The response to domestic abuse in a place of this scale is consistent in its localism, informed by clear and decisive strategic intent and delivered by skilled practitioners who understand the impact of domestic abuse on young children.</td>
      <td>How the experiences of child victims of domestic abuse aged 0 to 7 are consistently captured across the partnership. The extent to which children are recognised as victims of domestic abuse in their own right across the partnership. The timeliness and consistency of information-sharing across the partnership to inform risk assessments and safety planning.</td>

      <td>The need for an intelligence profile of the criminal exploitation of children has recently been identified by leaders in the partnership and commissioned by the police. The child sexual exploitation profile needs to be updated. This means that the ability of the partnership to understand the extent of child criminal exploitation in Northumberland is currently limited.</td>
      <td>The MASH has effective systems in place which ensure that new concerns about children are responded to in a timely manner. In the main, thresholds are understood, and the risk of significant harm is identified. Timely strategy meetings are held and include the right professionals.</td>
